## üîç **Problem Identified:**

The deployment is failing because Netlify is trying to use Node.js version `20.19.4`, which doesn't exist. <mcreference link="https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/manage-dependencies/#node-js-and-javascript" index="0">0</mcreference>

## üõ†Ô∏è **SOLUTION: Fix Node Version Configuration**

### **Method 1: Update netlify.toml (Recommended)**

Update the <mcfile name="netlify.toml" path="c:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Organized Business model\Bolt bolt new website 3 18 25\Submit Pinecone working maximized 6 28 25\unionbolt-ai-hackathon\netlify.toml"></mcfile> file:
