a perfect breaking ground for the bacteria Dr Nolan please say recognizing symptoms like games with whispering to do the difference between lighting down with those at risk One of my favorite movies of all time That being said this specific scene is just absolutely similar let's get into it The first thing that occurs before either of them even say a word is a great they waive each other despite the fact that they are enemies they decide to acknowledge the other That may not have been quite much but the fact that they decide to wait for the other to speak first can also be seen as a sign of courtesy Wait what did somebody just say Somebody is great open politely asking for when to draw his this is not a threat this is a reflex and how does the King of Jerusalem respond at any age And the first two words are I pray probably is not only matching sound of his energy but he also wishes him a safe concern to Damascus But the words you choose to use show that he is not making threats what stands out is not necessarily what all he chooses to say but instead when he chooses to not save all one doesn't tell Saudi that if he does not withdraw a keyboard I can't he is saying that all of us the hundreds of thousands of Muslim and Christian knights diet or something Everyone knows that the King of Johnson is a leper yet soundly decides to lower his gate as a sign of empathy You go so far as simple in this variable positions and out of all the response they do and precisely in the Arab and the language of Saladin the language of the Muslim people and the language and how the sound may respond Saladin answered forward Salah despite the fact that he is not a listener despite the fact that he is a Christian despite the fact that he is the enemy And then we just see consistent just in the mall which you just witnessed She just wants her brother on a saladine and his entire army to withdraw using nothing for the words now well because on the surface nothing happened there was no dynamic heights no big reveal those kind of anticipation Let us go back to the beginning to explore to those story Our planning is still a lot of our president He's an actor comedian and Saturday night Free He said he said he's a pig he's a confident goddess but doesn't understand how does it Does it appear this is gaming society doesn't pay us access is it any polar powers a national disaster it's an embarrassment for this country it makes me so angry two times on your winner Hollywood legend standing on a five stage staring straight into the camera and delivering one of the most blistering takedowns ever seen on national television and within hours Donald Trump lost it disguised as a workshop speech and Justin is clear and I think you're about to see in 3 because what De Niro said next set on the fire department still hasn't burned out and yes it starts right here i'm gonna say one thing But it wasn't just about it was about what those names represented to millions the fear that their democracy had been high chance by someone dangerously unfinished with the neural drama it wasn't for shock value It was the boy's voice The crowd cheered not because it was old but because it was overdue did you feel like the Nero was just saying out loud when they are thinking quietly right now I'd like to punch him in that place this is someone that won the president I don't think so What I care about is correction and what I'm very very worried about is that it might help in the world It was a warning when Robert the hero said he wanted to punch Donald Trump it wasn't about ego it was about fear fear that the country was heading towards something something unamerican and when he asked I But I also have the features I was actually really impressed with this but getting there was definitely a bit of a role that being said so let's get started I guess so I have a tree for place where about 25 years Citizenship attack on this other Trumps alleged that was talking about what she experienced was terrific and he also had a dowel john tried his owner again by firing the person who prosecuted the resources confirmed to NBC News that Maureen Assistant US attorney in the morning can leave the daughter over FBI director James 40 she argued What's the weather like in What's the weather today Hello Similar to All right Hey Cortana That's cool to hear I am super glad to be here as always we're about to pull it into what looks like 1007 2008 Hyundai I believe it's Santa Fe customer service the AT is not working or charging or something like that against blowing hot which makes sense to do we have 100% $95 earlier and verify our customers complete here Maybe not well feels a little too but I have a few so we're used to instrumentation to tell us a little undercharge what we're gonna do is bring this into the shop i'm gonna throw the AC in the coverage and down to this unit we're gonna take a look at the pressures and take a look at the temperatures here In this video we are going to get rid of the confusion between guarding how to install we take dry 1 i'm going to show you every every process what order you do it in this really basic and simple these are my tools OK have a copy I have a 4 inch 6 inch and a 4 by 10 trot this is a flat trot that's not current doesn't have a work in it OK that's it that's what I use II use paper tape It's the foundation but all of the driver wants now you better see one of our videos before when I share tips and tricks and we got a few good acts Democrat was on Joe Rogan and approved him away pointed out Christian hypocrisy you know outside that as you know Joe has an extremely right wing audience so it's important that we have folks anywhere and everywhere talking but we might not otherwise socks off as I said but people have socks off now if you don't know the reason why he was on Joe Wilkins because a couple of months ago he went a firewall talking about the 10 Commandments and hypocrisy in Texas Legislature was going through and trying to put them into schools here here's a bit of what is the 22% folder is not working on the 7th that is that is Yep what day is the Jewish 7th day and what day is it today Christian 7th is what they tell her everything that Jesus was from and we're scheduled to give this bill a final close on what day of the week if I want it isn't it Which you can believe that puts code in your bills so that we're not breaking the temp demands by working on the Jewish Christian Saturn I love that you said that because you're saying that you'd rather tell people to follow the commandments than follow it yourself I love this guy I love this guy turns out so does Joe Rogan so here is the best bits from Joe Rogan's 3 hour interview with him I don't want you to have to sit through all of this but if you want to search on here on Youtube for Joe Rogan here is James talking about how the words think that could have a tyrant pretending like the exhibition for God and again this is very personal given how important my faith is to be like I'm A Christian and I think there is no more dangerous form of government than the opposite because the only thing worse than a tyrant is a tyrant who makes no mission from God and we haven't had any good examples of that in the past no it's not one that you go on I don't want to work out hey again this is people trying to use my religion to control people that's that's the name of the game and we're seeing that here I mean Texas is I'm an 8th generation Texan famous manner since it was Mexico I love this state but I just see people i've done it books just take us in this far right culture war direction at the expense of actual problems when you solve one of the bills that didn't pass last letter was last legislative session was a bill that would have provided funding for flood vacation and emergency emergency systems to get the word out in the flood and we literally just saw the the consequence of not passing that so we just kept on going this is a longer clip but one that is really important for me as a gay man and I don't think a lot of people who want to snow that I'm gay you mentioned it sometimes when it's not the most important thing about me but it is a thing about me and as I get more subscribers I feel like I have to keep coming out to everyone so yes but here he is talking about how being anti gay is not what Jesus would have taught And this is a brilliant brilliant submission we've always had a separation of church and state it's been very important the staunchest offenders for the separation of church and state without American history of Protestant Christians that doesn't particularly right I mean the letter Jefferson writes when he first uses that phrase a wall of separation between church and state was to the Danbury Baptist these Protestants were fleeing Europe as religious minorities kind of essential to the founding of this country was religious freedom and so those Christians understood that once the government Yeah you know I look across my church on Sunday mornings and I see a lot of Gray hair I worry about the future of my church of my faith in this country what do you think that's about I think a lot of it is well justified because organized religion has done a lot of damage to people too many churches too many faith leaders have abused that trust a lot of Gen ZA lot of my fellow millennials when they hear me talking about my faith and how it forms my public service they're like I've i've never heard of this kind of Christian right like I was told if you want to be a Christian you had to get hit people you want to be Christian you want to control them protect science and so with Gen Z and millennials were faced with that choice it was a pretty easy choice for them they chose their gay friend they chose women's rights Is here with the very latest that's right to leave let's see this day after reviewing security footage they are sure it was an intentional act they also say the driver was kicked out of the club for being disruptive about eight minutes before he drove a Nissan onto the sidewalk ramming it into the crowd and injuring at least 30 people selling hey there what is happening youtubers thanks for stopping back into the channel today right here with the rest of our mechanic so today we're getting into some air conditioning work we're going to be looking into the insurance and outs of air conditioning for the gas I have a lot of questions and there are guys

into the easy insurance and outs of air conditioning systems and hopefully help you guys to diagnose some of these easy issues with some quick simple tools so stay tuned This tiny laptop is running a 70 million parameter Play the computer really immediately so right above Hey it's Max from UNFTR for the Midas Touch Network and I'm here because you know there are no late night hosting things breaking news PDF is canceling The Late Show there it's pretty strange announcement yeah what about CBS would end such a story franchise in all of these years when according to the statement that they released it was purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night the CEO of Paramount even made sure to say that it's not related in any way anyway to the show's performance content the other matters happening in Paragon that's really because you know for a second there some people are speculating that it had something to do with Colbert's monolog saying that Naraman's payouts for 60 Minutes lawsuit amounted to a vote You see Paramount's in discussions to merge with the company called Sky Dancing and they need to include the merger even said in that same final out that people in the media were already writing about how Colbert himself like potentially be silenced is the results of the merger with Sky Dance it becomes even more obsequious to Trump So obviously it's curious timing considering that he gave that monolog and then they announced a couple of days later that they're not just canceling the bear they're getting rid of the whole late night program it's been around for like 35 years Sure they're not related right so except that something doesn't quite feel right know what I mean so why don't we dig into it so proportionally prepared they actually have to release financial data often and fortunately for us they did so at the end of last quarter as public so required to do and look I'm sure it's nothing more than a financial decision like they said liars don't just say one thing when they need another super pronouncements that don't protest too much and they take this off this end by saying something like it's not the financial reasons it's not because of content the content is great I mean that would be like saying that you have Steam files should be released and if they're on my desk right now and then say there's a list by that would be nuts just very dumb no but I'm sure the man and then words out I said why don't we just take a look So what we see here is the picture of the Paramount as a parent company for CVS that cares the late show with the Bear you can see that it has three major business events got the TV unit correcting consumer unit and the build entertainment Commission so these numbers are in A million so that the top line figure is $7 billion in revenue broken down by four and a half billion TV dollars 2 billion in direct to consumer and 627,000,000 in debt 13 so another of course I think were there enough is that I know how to read a financial statement so before we drill down to show you how we asked this announcement was earnings are down to the whole company in the same quarter last year because they had a significant so it looks like their numbers are down from last year which is undoubtedly the argument that they're going to make But they have an auditor's note very clear and present in the financials making sure to clarify that their revenues actually up by 2% year over year with the exclude the Super Bowl so all units are going in revenue and what the press release says one can only assume that the TV event is dragging them down right so they reported $688,000,000 in operating income for depreciation amortization interest and reserving for taxes and stuff like that and that will make your eyes bleed but go to the detailed financials in the release it shows that the true earnings and interest expense and other non operational losses is around 334 it's not too shabby but hang on that's actually a pretty significant cut in their upgrade right I mean operating income right is a $600 million of revenue less expenses they make $600 million but when they go to the national earnings it's down to 334 and that's because we're really interesting of $217,000,000 for their right so that let's go into the business units quickly before we make a couple of educated guesses as well as we're coming on here this is where the Paramount streaming services are struggling to get off the ground the major brands took under this division apart from Paramount Plus BET Plus and Pluto TV Let's go to TV you might ask I have no idea i'm asking 'cause I literally like what that is So we're looking for profits here and Nope even Yellowstone couldn't turn this unit around because it lost $109 billion in a single quarter and that's like social level OK so clearly it's not here so let's check the next one Next up we have Build Entertainment who doesn't love a good paramount with him all right so let's check the numbers all right so there's our 627,000,000 advertising money theatrical at least dough licensing and the unit makes $20 million for the quarter so that's a meta 20 million year loss of 109,000,000 at the other business unit and only one business unit oh so wait a minute so if the building unit is barely making any money in the screening services aren't averaging cash Yeah you guessed it welcome to Paramount's cash count Yeah there you have it black and white circle the red $922,000,000 to go into advertising subscription and licensing adding them $922,000,000 for the quarter and over there on the right side it's 1 of the things that they literally just have it as being number one and by the way Colbert's Late Show was the highest rated late night for seven straight seasons and it just reclaimed the mantle again this year There's a daily dealership in our 2.4 million people which is way ahead of the others in the same time as higher numbers but he's a good hour and a half earlier and Colbert also has 10 million Youtube subscribers so it also makes money on the aftermarket on the blind and on social media is clearly speculation about that they got rid of Colbert just to please Trump and to get ahead of him so that his FCC3 personal transaction is a very curious timing to say the least but it's the rationality that really misses people so remember that thought that I told you to hold here's the thing the deal itself with Skype is valued at around $8 billion but it stands to create a combined value of 28 pills and one of the reasons that Paramount is so deeper to make this deal is because it's saddled with doubt even by Wall Street's worst standards Paramount's long term debt to earnings Asset ratios are garbage they need this merger the shareholders really need this merger so one of the first things that Sky Dance is reported they're gonna do is ship us but they also agree to use some of this cash to pay down the debt in the nightmare but the last thing you do is kill a cash cow heading into a deal like this by all metrics the Late Show just an example of that natalie shows bringing as much money as they used to not even close are they burgers plus leaders for the networks not at all but to take the leader out of the mix all together this order my breakfast because remember we're not talking about an audience and revenue when you're talking about the highest rated among peers by a one shot it's a super brand name that they meet the company invested in And there's tremendous crossover between one of Maryland's other building shows as well the Daily Show where Colbert 1st became a nationally known figure now they can put everything to bed pretty quickly by breaking out their financials which they do not do in fact none of the networks do that to show you which show makes money and which doesn't just show us that number for you know the prime time slot that's been on top since inception and has crossover revenue coming from other platforms and say it isn't properly please close but to show them it's a valued part of your suite of number one shows in your own business unit that's successful in your earnings report just to turn around two months later and say it's a loser and we're getting rid of the guy who literally just criticized you two days prior to cancelation it was absolutely shocked with the rest of the country not a good look now when the dust settles here's the part that I think we really need to pay attention to there's something called a chilling effect in speech and it's used mostly the legal ground to describe the circumstance for free speech it's a great it's a pretty high bar to play for sure that we would pay after much better job of breaking that down but it's important to know that the private company can do pretty much whatever it wants so that's why we're so called free speech maven Elon Musk shuts off and exit counting someone criticizes and another platform shadow bands marginalized voices it's technically not a violation because it's on a private part so when ACDO decides to silence a voice networks and financial reasons it's not a violation of free speech you have a right to state your opinion in theory in a public square without threat of retribution to the government but therein lies the problem are increasingly privatized and incorporate public private square the lines are very blurry and people want to try out about cancer culture but that's not a thing but when a high profile expeaches in time event like canceling a television program the heels of being criticized at a moment when the US Congress just moved to eliminate funding already allocated to public broadcasting We're in that moment we're dissenting voices over foreign temperaments and disappear from the streets over our beds or just attending rallies That's when I was they're not just wary they get pressed and I don't really care about Paramount I don't really care about Stephen Colbert or any Colbert enterprise for that matter to the extent that these voices exist in primarily entertained and they're subject to the whims of the masters this is the system we've chosen that I care very much about the chilling effect in society with large for those who express dissenting humans governments exhibiting to its citizens are targeted by that same government to firing Colbert that will get evidence at night 27 but let's keep our eyes on the prize because this singular action exists but not in the same spectrum which the generous end of it but there's another end of it is what one word your neighborhood or your coworker might disappear to see the reported just for speaking out against ocean this is the silvery slope that people talk about but I would ask you to acknowledge the top of the hill where the headline Gravity corporate actions like Paramount cancel Barry existence but really look further down him to the bottom of that slippery slope there's so many whistleblowers and consented voices are called really been silenced in ways that we haven't seen in this country since we directed Return themselves and even some on US soil and that's attention to disgustingly transparent and it's OK to be outraged just make sure that you channel that outrage it's areas of our society with clear protections than late night closes though the parish was that's where the action is provided such network a maps from the next Unmute on Youtube or visit our website at UNNTR .com to sign up for a three weekly newsletter we are Origin essays download Progressive resource Hello honey Donald Trump's dog pass it's resurfacing ways it's worse nightmare So I think we should explore how did Donald Trump eat over here on or around the same time he was best friends with Jeffrey Epstein We should build a timeline to see Donald Trump went to a club in Manhattan for reaching Cat Club where there were parties that were frequently thrown were very rich and happy This video I'll show you how to hand drive on by yourself Do it right now In this video I'm going to show you how to handle by yourself you're going to do it right now My number one tip of maybe drywall by yourself don't just don't sit there and you sit in your other help you out we got to run the risk of courteous whatever you do some construction for their run that risk and then we do it by yourself The wrist is even high of course there's a risk in everything that you do if you're like me you can have 12 bags of rosaries within a house because you don't want to make second trip to run the risk of hurting yourself that much so why are you even making this video well somebody like me always does stop by themselves and it's not because I don't have any friends although I joke about that all the time really the reason is is because I work at a different case I know a lot of you probably don't put up projects for months at a time Yes so do you have to slow down to like videos along the way but there might be certain things where you like to work at your own base and you know want to put somebody through that or you want to call somebody do not rapidly by the time you get the drywall from the telepheny of the store in your truck back home and into the house should be starting to learn how to move into the sheets and everything that's gonna help you install Another thing to take into account is the size of the drywall as far as thickness goes can't just kind of the standard you want to go thicker or fireflow reasons or whatever you want to do We have 5/8 we have quarter inch and heading over existing that wall but I use handcuffs from everyone the sheets come four foot by foot or by 10 foot 12 foot and I think it's six foot here's where there's gonna be some controversial in this video I have 9 by 11 i'm gonna use 8 first and people are gonna say this is 19 just get a 10 footer gotta put off it and you won't have any seams during this one well that is true i'm sorry just getting in first for this front everything I'm gonna say because I'm doing it myself you know putting a shorter sheet up here and having a seat over here is gonna be totally worth taking sand my face off from here no matter what it's too let's proceed to a slow is not going to be a big deal in fact I'm going to cut the sheets even smaller than that probably about a 6 foot sheet here three foot sheet here and then that way it'll be even less everything started and I've seen people paying 12 foot sheets by themselves So you figured out how much drywall you need what size you need got into your house you can't have a kind of house. So now you can sell it and the good thing is you don't need this most important ones tape measure utility knife pencil inch and a corner that's all screws which is very nice you don't have to worry about course we don't need to know what we will be as a little bit pocket sheet up it's the one with the ceiling as you'll see that really makes it a million times easier Talk about this a little later on I guess that would necessarily meet this using knife but it would be like one of these now we want to figure out where our first on the start right this corner I always start from the ceiling it is the hardest part anyways so we'll get out of the way and it's strapping this plastic runs this way so I'm going to hand in the sheets So that's a long way it was this way and 4 feet turns out this way and I'm going to cut my first sheet so that it's on this piece of scraping cap on it and then over here there this bike is that's going to be my next because I do still want to stagger my scenes so that when I mud it and sand it it blends in better I did a seam all the way down here This way it's just your practice staggers so I have my measurement here from Beth wall to where I want to find a tap on top that's back to the edge right here so I have a nice It's going up here I could have cut this over here to make it square but either way you wanna do it it's fine and obviously you have lights or anything in the ceiling you wanna mark those before you put the sheet up I have my diagram right here for where the lights are going and I know where my smoke detector is over here so I can do all that afterwards next sheet we can adventure I want to make sure it's lined up like here so that way when I click this pizza She's going there but I'm doing this by myself There you go Pull up now next one does it appear have it on the scrapping Had it right there and then belong same way as the rest of the put this right here By the way no haven't brought well done we don't want to buy one just for one job you can get one of these same exact thing that's already preset i'm just putting some electrical tape around the top because the bin tends to pop off sometimes and that would be a lot cheaper than buying drywall let's keep that left And that was the worst thing ever fell out of this guy Australia I haven't had good luck with them now to jam up in situations like that with a new camera you have to close sheet above your head And as you know on here give friends to yourself if you're gonna be one of this and any of these screws that are sticking down Take out anyone's one for some reason it must be done Whatever I have to cut it's this back wall That's tight How we can retire our little friends for this job just in case of that question so I roll expert Is done so I can go back here on the end here it has about a 6 inch piece so I took this in multiple pieces It doesn't really matter because I have corrosion going right here that I'm gonna have to mud and then I'm gonna have to bring this way out to here so this is basically a lot up to about here so I figured that use up the scraps that I have and some extra in the basement let's see Of course like you talked about earlier for here and then ripped on the bottom of the and this one that's fine I just don't like the vertical circuits and that's just how I am another thing I've heard is that people like to do the bottom sheet first so they'll sit on the ground and then they'll take the next one and then set it up right on top of that one and in theory that makes sense over the house that's not perfect nothing's level nothing's square it's never gonna work out you're gonna have to rip the top and it's gonna walk harder to do that I thought it was to rip the bottom and that's what I like to do I like to talk sheet up first and then it's about 1/4 inch on the bottom as long as it's the bottom plate is covered i'm OK with that and then pry that up to the piece that I put on the top and holler down that's how I do it that sounds gonna do it that's how I'm gonna show you I guess there's more than one way to spend a cap Not perfect Something was in this house you know way back like this Tell me all the question like we have our first sheet colony right here right about there this is a great example of an imperfection of the wall basically what was happening because this stud and this study are out further this way than this one so I started putting screws in they started talking through the drywall just like that right there So what I had to do was a whole bunch of screws in here to get them to the point where they wouldn't be breaking through the paper like this one this one avoiding ones like that so I've gotten it to a point where the drywall just won't move around it looks a little goofy but it's all going to be mutted in anyways just want to make sure there's not going to be any movement because then these start Now before we hang this sheet I want to show you how I'm going to cut this out show you how that goes up to it so when I say roto zip this is the tool I'm talking about roto zip actually the brand name this is made by Bosch I think it's called a Rotary tool or a Rotary saw I think that's the official name but I call it a rotor because it's easy to remember and it has 2 different types of this standard point bit and then you have these which have a guide to for a trace limit that looks like this right here this is the standard one and this is the one I like to use when I'm cutting around plastic boxes for electrical metal boxes for can lights or when you go around playing that way this it won't accidentally cut into the boxes so the brain in too much like this one tends to you can still use this one to go around that stuff but you don't have a lot of experience with saw like this this one it's definitely the way to go it makes it a lot of this event so I'm going to change out a bit that's on here and that went up by the way we can just use the utility backside here just do it until we take a while and also certain situations This is kind of a small area if you just use this guide and right using this right hand because it doesn't create as much dust but guide the saw of the flower Can see that this is not a little bit except that would be a lot worse if you're using the standards pretty good and we put this piece up Hey now it's time to send and I like to stagger my scenes get this window wasn't here and the scene is right here I would make sure it's scattered seems doesn't really matter when there's a window there but sometimes I like to put seams like here under the window because it's sort of seamless But what I'm gonna do so here with this double stud that way I can use this full 8 foot piece so the first thing I want to do is type length it's already cut to the length I need and then so we're going to rip the bottom so this is where you want to be mindful of where you want your factory scene to land I want it to be here so that's that we see is right here so I want to rip this I want this accordingly and then I just want to measure a couple different places 46 or three quarters 46 and a half 46 1/2 46 1/2 So on your purpose for about 46 and 3/8 I'll have a small gap at the bottom that'll make it easier to work with here I don't wanna share that in there is that right next 638 So now I want to be mindful of where my boxes are I have one if the sheep is going to go over I'm not going to cut it out right now I'll cut it out afterwards but I want to mark it so the sheet is upside down this is actually going to come here so the center of that box 27 1/2 and right here 7 1/2 And then I told this guy like the best That's the first that is the center of my box and just make sure that all the wire less Don't look too close to this box because right now I'm gonna take my rotosip and this is the center mark for that box i'm just gonna plunge cut this and go about 1/2 inch past this drywall and then find the edge That's good that's what happens together I don't like these required insulated boxes Drywall sits on the flamethrower It's freezing sometimes If you can do what I just did on the ceiling or on the walls I have all the faith in the world that you can drywall an entire room by yourself again I highly recommend you get some help but if you can't I hope this video helps you out I have a couple more videos on drywall and taking the money I'll leave links to those videos in the description of this one along with a playlist of this entire roaming model if you want to see I see something tight when we use and the customers might need to help equipment's a 900 talk about tractions but while you're paying for those things China just dropped three AI agents that are going to be changing again and I think with the the first one scored 65.8 on the hardest code test the second one is the best factor and the third got so popular that you buy codes for 7 for thousands of black output but these are a moment stem and there's a reason these schools are free And once you understand why you'll see why this changes everything in the business julian Bowie greets everything so make sure you find the what you think about this channel let's start with the 1st one as blown lines in this form of key K2 and this is another thing I this one claims the games websites apps To come up with this more adorable reliable and very long lasting material I spent almost five years preliminary research The material is just kind of technological and at the same time you can see there is nothing in this composition that you can't find right away in a restaurant a group covered with this material is fine 1 point lesson and as a service app of more than 50 years the material is so new that the industry hasn't yet managed to start its production but it's very easy to make this living yourself Donna Donald Trump's dog cast continues to surface and we here at the Midas Touch that won't have this exclusive report for you we've managed to locate video from a 1991 beauty pageant called Look of the Year that Donald Trump flew with a guy named John Casablancas from Elite Model Management casablanca died in 2013 allegedly from brain cancer at a fairs sexually assaulted 15 year old girl 17 year old girl I never go through Casablanca's background with you we hear a lot about Trump's connections with Epstein donald Trump was also very close with this Casablanca's guy who elite Model agency was used to prey on underage girls as well right so let me share this with you you have Donald Trump at this 1991 Here are some of the photos that we have seen him right here the little girls would come into the room again mostly underage they would come into the room in bathing suits very little clothing and he would sit there and he would judge them and he would determine if they can make it through the next round here are some of the photos we've been able to identify you can see Donald Trump right there looking at these girls who would make where the bathing suits I kind of blocked in front of him and again somebody's girls as young as 14 here's a photo of what the actual competition looked like from the 1991 Look of the Year this was from the Guardians report on it I mean read for you what they said what happened the night before the event and I'm gonna show you some of the video that we've been able to locate up in my dispatch network so this was a photo from the Guardian article still from a previously unseen footage of the 1991 Look of the Year finale There are articles about 10 years ago so team models powerful men and private dinners when Trump posted a look of the years actually from 2020 in the early 1990s Donald Trump judge the world's biggest modeling competition since hit by allegations of abuse this is how people were there remember on September 1st 1991 a large private yacht food store the Statue of Liberty it was a clear breezy evening and from the upper deck of the Spirit of New York at Golden Sunset could be seen glimpting off the Manhattan sky Downstairs a party was inflowed scores of teenage girls in evening dresses and mini skirts some as young as 14 danced under disco lights it could have been a high school prom or not for the crowd of older men surrounding them as the evening world some of the men many old enough to be the girl's fathers or even grandfathers join them on the dance floor pressing themselves against the girls one balding man in a suit wrapped his arms around two young models underage girls leering into the film camera that was documented in the evening can you get some beautiful women around me please the party aboard the Spirit of New York was one of several events that Donald Trump then 45 attended with a group of 58 aspiring young models that September mostly underage girls and it talks about how they were this was part of the Elite Look of the Year competition elite Model Management was run by John so constant work is marriage to his second wife Jeanette Christensen ended in 1983 when it was revealed he was having a an affair with a 15 year old girl who can describe as a woman child is how he described the girls that he would be with them woman Child is one of Donald Trump's best friends and then he had a marriage to Eileen Wall **** It was a 17 year old from the Look of the Year competition a 2020 Guardian investigation into elite Slip of the Year competition uncovered allegations from formal Protestants and industry insiders that these competitions the events are about to show you that Trump attended as well were used by Casablancas and others to engage in sexual relationships with vulnerable young models some of whom were teenagers the allegations range from sexual harassment exploitation and in some cases rape the investigation highlighted a culture where young girls often age 14 to 18 were exposed to older men in powerful positions at events like after when when journalists took it and made it serious I thought it was a little bit unfair having said that though Donald Trump would come on my show and this is why he was great most people there having that thought keep that pretty guarded not down he was right into it there was no filter I go done Donald Angelina Jolie she's one of the most beautiful actresses in the world she's a 6 you know Howard Stern didn't claim to start a political sword but when his old interviews with Donald Trump were played back on live TV unfiltered unedited unmistakably real something shifted what exactly did Trump say about women about power even about his own marriage and why is Melania suddenly aware to be seen While Howard simply told the stories the real shot came after as Trump's passwords collided with today's spotlight what you're about to hear is a groomer spin or second hand planes these are characters own words recorded in real time broadcast to billions stay tuned the fallout starts now donald Trump hands down whatever you put him on the air now this is before he was an open book we have to talk about Donald Trump he's a big character difficult because he's a big character on my shot that's just considered that this is one of the best guess ever various where this goes it subscribe because the next part isn't just wild it's revealing for Howard's turn Trump wasn't just another guest he was the show a walking headline unfiltered unpredictable and depending on who you ask uncomfortably honest back then no one was asking about optics or public image trump said what he thought stern let the tape roll what follows were interviews that drew laughs gasps and now a second because when a guest says everything sometimes is what no one questions that ends up being the most revealing actually what is good either way to work piece of **** and for that company and I go out with somebody and she's like 21 and she's talking about that I want to be doing she's studying algebra So what and it's like those always embarrassing 4 it was took me a 30 second perfect day absolutely she has enough life insurance 35 what is it a 35 hours called checkout time and you'll probably I would say the greatest judge of beauty on this I would create a TV show for you where all you did was just Judge Lemon that makes me the best idea of all it's a simple thing it's 1/2 hour you strip it out so I don't say I do it all the time here's where the tone shifts Over the years Donald Trump appeared on Howard Stern's show again and again engaging in conversations that for a while passed as outrageous entertainment but now these recordings are doing more than raising eyebrows trump rated women by number joked about walking backstage at and responded to remarks about his own daughter with silence or worse agreement what was played for laughs now plays on who and the timing could it be worse because as these tapes research so do new questions not just about Trump good behavior but about his private life and suddenly it's not the media asking those questions it's the silence beside him I think so he's far and close to prompt in the country of second order nature is the owner of the pageant is your obligation to do that so so you have the backstage for your shift and everyone's getting dressed and ready and everything else and no matter anywhere now I'm allowed to do it because I'm the only project that left what I'm expecting They're starting to make sure they're like is everyone OK because they do they would come to play is everybody OK you see these incredible looking women and so they started to get away with it was unfair to try because like for example they were fond of quoting that Donald Trump had something to said something to the effect that studios were his personal what are the most replayed lines from Trump's appearances on Howard Stern was a remark where he compared his daily life to serving in the military stirred would later say it was never meant seriously just part of the late night humor but those moments didn't stand alone they were part of a long string of energy about women's appearances shared unfiltered stories and laughed through comments post would hesitate to make what really gives us in a very joking scenario he was not preparing his life it was ha ha ha and this amount for years they were brushed aside as just Trump being Trump but today they're echoing through headlines campaign stops and his own home because for someone like Melania who's built an image on quiet dignity hearing it all again isn't just embarrassing it's a public unraveling or something she never spoke about and now can't ignore so if that was just the set up what happens when the old footage goes mainstream again when the headlines hit home and even Melania stops showing up stay with us because what Howard's about to say next might explain why things look colder than ever inside Mar a Lago to Donald Trump's stuff is just amazing I mean they're out of the book it'll say and now present I never would have a passion that when when when Trump actually started to win I never imagined that I could use casters quoting my show by as we survive and it was just so weird because I had all this wealth of material with Donald Trump who by the way was the best radio guess ever because he would just say things that no one on the planet would say And he's still saying that yeah yeah and so the book Jimmy called it amazing Howard called it weird and now it's everywhere late night shot jabs turned into daytime headlines reporters quoting Stern like he's CNN and Trump still miked up still unfiltered except now the audience includes his wife his critics and just maybe his legal team because these weren't jokes whispered off air these were performances reported in full played on loot and somewhere between the punch lines and the playback the image of control of unity of that picture perfect political couple started to crash melania didn't make a statement she didn't have to when a first lady disappears from the frame you don't need a press release you need to ask what exactly did she hear that made her step back But don't tell her often though she might reveal her true feelings at least Melania stands fully behind Donald Trump's message well I don't know what to believe what he treats OK well first of the time but she's definitely useful to have around when you forget things like raising your hand for the national anthem You know what maybe this is why Donald Milani is sleeping separate veterans she was laughing too hard on my monolog she hasn't issued a statement she hasn't sat for an interview but you don't need a press release to see what's happening in recent events Melania has kept her distance visibly physically and unmistakably the space between her and Donald isn't just metaphorically it's a literal gap notice my cameras circled my tabloid and of course T like this maybe this is why they sleep in separate bedrooms jimmy jokes she was laughing too hard at my monolog it lands like a punchline but the silence that follows that's no joke because while Trump fights off headlines at Heckler the one person who used to stand beside him isn't even in the shop it's a weird relationship I would thought I was at my wedding remember having a very long feelings for Donna that's why I couldn't even believe that I will not get this all to work out for Howard tried to be fair Donald was at my wedding he said I remember having very warm feelings for him but even he admits something about the relationship never quite made sense a strange chemistry public smiles private tension and a growing sense that baby just maybe even Trump didn't believe it that's not something you hear from critics that's from someone who sat across from him unfiltered before the campaigns before the scandals before the distance And when a man knows for reading people starts questioning the sincerity of it all you can't help but wonder who's still pretending and who quietly stopped I have looked at the way these two bumpers interact with each other it's positively smoldering please welcome our commander in chief my husband President this is personal today To me there's nothing more beautiful watching a man and his wife try not to splutch each other's frogs in cream you know Melania hasn't said a word but maybe that said everything what do you think her silence means drop a comment below and just like clockwork he did what he always knows when the spotlight burns too hot Trump doesn't reflect he retaliates coming up his classic counter attack the silent rebellion of Melania and the question no one dares ask out loud how much longer can this show go on we're sticking to public clips of real reactions and what they might reveal beneath the surface no speculation just what's been said and what's been seen Like Howard Howard's on Howard Stern show as much as anybody he was good at that time and then he went yeah for a couple of reasons and there it is when things get personal Trump gets predictable instead of addressing the substance he does on his favorite playbook blame the Woke master ratings and accuse everyone of turning on him this time even Howard Stern becomes just another name on the ever growing list of traders but while Trump's voice gets louder Melania's gets quieter noticeable like the opposite of walk to me is a sleep but I click on the lake this must have got Trump all charged up because at 3 o'clock in the morning on a Saturday technically Sunday who starts tweeting out the Howard Stern is a broken loser **** **** not loyal you know the usual the tirade I thought to myself like I thought it was what Thank you activate the 45th President of the United States So of course but Howard didn't flinch he fired back with something sharper than insulin disbelief you were the 45th president of the United States and this is what keeps you up at night it wasn't just a dig it was a beer a reminder that the man was surrounded by power now pleads to petty huge like a lifeline and while Trump keeps chasing attention the people around him one by one are choosing distance The one who once stood silently by his side you know his lovely What's the forecast for my favorite spirit Dusty water is 34 Insufficiency news comes after presidents of a third that was swelling up his ankles on his right hand So Sanjay what what is this Yes I recommend you say this to me I met Donald Trump at some parties I I told you that I was working for Mr Jekyll testing there was about three or four times that I had done I was 13 the first time that I met Donald Trump was at the party at Jeffrey Esteem's mansion We were he was really an **** going on and he was And washing off the distance and and he basically asked if I could come over and give him taking a **** **** and at first I wasn't very comfortable this was like my 1st reset in the 1st party and II didn't you know I didn't think that that was my responsibility but my recruiter told me that I needed to do it so I agreed to and then he you know I said I said he began to sorry it was before I take a **** **** until I set my hand away and said you need to use a glove and the recruiter ran over and handed me blood and said no one touches Mr Chunks news without her gloves so I need to use a glove I gave him a **** **** and immediately after the orgasm he left my Jeffrey jeffrey Epstein is a billionaire friend of Donald Trump that was responsible for their own sex matters There was I originally came to New York trying to be model and in my travels I met a girl named Tiffany who was very interested in meeting said that initially that's what she did is that she helped girls and they were wanted and she could help me that she wanted them people that were that were higher up some that it would be no problem and so that's why she but I would just basically have to come model at a couple of events and meet some people would be no sweat so where's my land you know it sounds like no good deal She was recruiting the girls to come to these parties and they all looked at most of them were my age so maybe a couple of girls that were 14 or 15 but it seemed to me like we were all very empty so Jeffrey Epstein knew that I was 13 years old when he interviewed me He asked me to get down to my ground My **** and I thought that was weird but remodeling maybe it was something about my figure And he asked that I didn't even massage so he and then he asked me my age he asked me and I told him you know told him I was 13 I told him why I was there And he waves a blaze or what you'll do you know I'm sure that you'll you'll get pretty nicely here and then he he tried to basically slip himself I pushed him away and I said you know I'm I'm because at that point in time I still believed that there was model and then there was the girl that did that like I thought there was a separation so yeah II told him that I wasn't interested in that but he said that I would do and as far as Donald Trump he knew that I was 13 I believe that Tiffany told him he seemed to take a life into me because I was I was so young and I was also a virgin so I was so like he wasn't really into having having girls that that were liked by the other guys he kind of you know like things to do with his first for lack of a better term but he was the one who to have Dexter dexter grabbed the front Donald Trump knew that I was 13 because the first the first time that I was there I took me actually suggested that and she had a whole bunch of different ways and I expressed interest in them and I almost told her that I would love to walk around with her and so I tried some on and there was a lot that she said it looked great on me so I wore that And Donald Trump had specifically asked about me because I remind him of his daughter she said let's start to fly so he knew the first time in the song but he took a lightning to me because I was talking the reason I'm coming out now is when it happened originally I just wanted to forget about the whole incident When I saw that he was running for president I felt it was my responsibility to come out and tell our country what kind of man this person is I don't think that we should include a dog catcher but along the running the greatest picture in the world after I went to be at the bus station she so we need to basically went to her house her apartment and got ready I put on a long way because it seemed fun to pretend to be so indifferent but we went to the party that I was basically interviewing for and Jeffrey Epstein was the one that was running the program he had a quick meeting with everyone that was employed and then he had a The first time that I met Jeffrey Epstein he did try to force himself inside me without getting to go ahead or anything and then on the IT was probably about the 3rd or 4th party is when he basically was it was it was another misogyny it was basically like it wasn't it wasn't drugs but it was there was penetration and I told him that I didn't want that but he kind of got a little bit too so I don't know there was something about him that I guess I kind of help him like I helped a lot of these in the 20s and by that time that that happened II kind of already started questioning maybe I wasn't there for modeling and maybe I was going to use for things and I felt that both in responsible I didn't see running to go to these footage after every party and I would stay by Mr There wasn't out of all the girls that were there would be I never I most of them were 13 14 I think the oldest one might have been sixteen just but just times sixteen and she'd been there for a while It was actually it was Tiffany he was he was he he he likes to watch other people have sex II it was so much he's a German he was a German germ so he rather than partaking he was watching so it took me I informed him that I was the Virgin and so he was I was basically so II so it was Sydney who introduced us Suddenly when I saw channel was same scenario he was on looking certainly at an **** and significant over to me and said that Donald Trump had requested but I performed and and never I've never done something like that with anybody so I was a little nervous so I walked up to him and he used to say they're very proud like And I just kind of moved in that direction and he kind of slapped me away and said what are you doing you know like I was saying like dirty filthy or something without a condom and it took me ran over and handed him continent apologizing profusely and said that we never have to be done that that when she looked at me and stolen like a child and said like no one that's not having Mcdonald's would always see me anytime he touched his things that he said Mcdonald's So I apologize and I prefer oral sex on him and once again once he was done he popped up and that's the last I saw open up that part it's like sometimes that so sometimes before the two of the things that I noticed that were weird with him but sometimes before the party seems to come over then Jeffrey Epstein in South would have kind of landed that and forth and he was very racist he said a lot of racist things that there was there was a lot of comments towards Mr Epstein about you know when the Jewish and faster so he's cheap and there was some resight saying something about the shape of his penis being directly related to his mole or I mean I'm I'm not too familiar with Jewish tradition so but I'm pretty sure that whatever he was saying wasn't very nice Also referred to notes people of Hispanic or you know Hispanic but home space was that was around the first time that the World State Center I think that we were fun in the 90s and he was talking about the **** **** and how we just get better off of the I didn't let him in a you know basically got rid of him every single one that was already here I thought I just he also loved to call black people on the planet University and key umm Arabic people who called Sandeep Ros the only time that can you try to give me some money was the last our last time where he acted out of great fantasy I was I was forced to give that money back because so but he just gave me the money I don't even know why he gave me but it was it was pretty good I it was a great fantasy to him but II love so there was those there was those two times and then there was after the next the next thing that was working with was that he had a fantastic where he walked in on his name makes basically making out and that he was some type of fantasy for him so she asked and I was at that point I was like I don't want to be involved with anything that has to do with him but she's like you are just basically the other one so there's nothing you ought to do you don't just you want to surprise me to be involved so I reluctantly I mean I felt like I did not have a choice there but they would reasonably he's walking in his 2 mates I was one of the mates of the white man and there was a Spanish film Maria through words and we were making out and he walks in and he gets really angry and threatens to send Cole immigration on Maria if she doesn't come over and make things right and give me a **** So while she is over there again a **** I am just which I mean I just feel scared like playing trying to clean up things and pretending like I'm trying to go back to my job with me and then he he's been sober than that but so bad for her Even though it is you should say it seems like an sailing Indian singing like it's a real Spanish as far as that and then we start you starting on her they said she didn't know her you know she wants it she wasn't even near going down to give him perform oral sex on him before he slapped her away and said you know what are you doing you know you need to put on them on and and she's trying to listen I'm so sorry and so you can't even can't even say what you're saying and you know just speaking English you know all the roducts right comments and then he said you know what you know what you're doing Now our next guest says Americans are living in a surveillance state and she is sounding the alarm about the dangers of technical authoritarianism british author and award winning investigative journalist Carol Kawala pulls it the rolling Archie and it's the title of our ongoing substance she's joining Paris Reuben to discuss the Trump administration's decision to use the data analytics company Palantir Technology Chris John thanks Carol Kedla thanks so much for joining us most of our audience might remember that you are a Pulitzer award winning journalist who worked at the Guardian for decades and now you've launched a sub stack which is called How to Survive the Golden Party in your column you write the opaque and unaccountable Silicon Valley companies and facilitated both Brexit and Trump are now It's the idea That's the idea of the oligarchy who are able to help change the game in the state we can see that relationship Area as well as a burnt out bolt right here is brought down here with all the lights out We're debating the resources of theory every year you play private news This video will go to discussion is similar to I've often said when people go through a series of firsts miss something in their model and modeling something that spreadsheet and building a list still better than waiting there but President of the Trump surprise countries around the world last week but hey guys Jeff here in today's video I'm going to show you how to install the toilet remember this 90% of all toilets installed in renovations are coming they want to have that happening in the house Access video on how to do it by way and you'll be successful All right guys tend to move the road here's the deal two little secrets I'm going to show you right now one is this you take a pill of water make sure you get this before you turn your water and you you you basically shocked the system and too much water too fast prints the vacuum there you go 2 of mine is similar down around here Play music that's a lot of water removed from the situation then you grab your shot back to the back of the sandwich is actually just showed up in the city and that should be the reason this is discussed and then we can get revolted water that's in this Now I can actually reach in and take off those two bullets and separate this from the ball enough underneath this is installed it's under compression there's a rubber gasket that's so the nut itself isn't on that part Just take the nug right on Hey Cortana we can remove this Now don't get a smash though as long as it's in the bin Now the toilet itself is looking down so let's get the rest of this water out and get it down to one that's as close to 0 if possible because were you working by yourself we don't want to have that come out on the other end and pick it up we don't want to load your way It only takes a couple of seconds to take care of this and then you're never going to have a water issue when you're doing the toilet slams there is a hole in the floor so when you're picking up your toilet water comes out it's going through that hole and into the ceiling underneath So if that happened to you that's disgusting there Now this is another brasswasher it's very standard OK shouldn't give us any real issue and it's obviously the cutest is still relaxed Tires to hold it right still so take this up or do you take a grinder to it whatever right just realize it's probably wax in the mix because it's a lot of the lot of it's pushed us through the exercises more So have yourself a paper salad baby so in this case we're trying to pull the self restricted so watch this So where do you start this No I got it all right everything to do lift the toilet and create conversion all right it also works really well OK so now we have a toilet that's completely bored of water disengaged the only thing left is the wax so let me look at a suction so the other to go tug here and then you don't have to worry about making a mess 'cause there's nothing left in here we go Oh lonely that is a massive OK so we got a lot of this real quick one what's the rule about toilets The flint needs to be as high as the book OK it's not there's there's room This is swollen the wax is almost nonexistent over here This is an economy wax so somebody needs this toilet put in a 99 cent wax ring instead of the $5 one that has a plastic mold to it and for the divergent and then the wax sets a lot higher Somebody has been in here and had a private and then they click this cheap layer man on top of the old vinyl

Alias Sense Weaver the man behind the invention of open AI gave a pretty strong speech at the University of Toronto he expressed great concerns about the upcoming AI which might disrupt our entire world watch this The reason it's not going to be because there is something a little different going on right now you'll leave you'll leave it the most I mean since I've ever this is something A tall and truly warm garden pit moved through almost everlasting material that is very easily cheap to make yourself an option that's faster than this garden deck is already still the test of time you can easily apply almost any finish to garden vegetables and this material giving them a truly unique look each garden beds can look simple and functional or they can include luxurious They are suitable for beginner gardeners advanced gardening enthusiasts and even for those who want Have you ever tried to take drywall with paper tape or maybe you've tried mesh tape or even 5 abuse if you fought with any of this I'm going to show you how to make all of these work and it's not that hard that's a guy videos and today what I'm going to do is cover the topic of how to keep with paper tape and not have the issues 'cause I know a lot of you have issues with the tape not sticking right with it bubbling which we call blisters and issues like that and No some of them all right well so this is part of a series of getting to know the Trump cabinet christy no started out in S Dakota she was a state legislator there and later became the governor of South Dakota and he showed him the time for a time in the House of Representatives in the House where I serve a bird she was a far right Republican known for her post sponsorship in the village Oklahoma is an open source tool that downtown's healthier is back with the news as we all know now the White House has actually confirmed that we all believe to do that donald Trump's health is not OK it's not OK and now we have ACNN Dr pointing out exactly what's wrong with Trump they actually push it back in the White House's lies but let's remember the reason why they're doing this is because they don't want us to talk about Epsilon I am unruly to abroad not just any brothel above those in Raymond about the price itself on being like the friends of friends prostitution is considered one of the most controversial questions in the world illegal for 49 out of 50 issues one thing I can't imagine doing is having sex if there was zero attraction II would I would really struggle Kick of the weather looks like paradise clear blue and peaceful But what's beneath the surface is claimed lives trust rescues and swallowed evidence forward for years divers have tried to map its deputy chambers only to be met with shifting gravel blacked out visibility and whispers of something down underwater drones are exposing what no human ever could and just when you think it couldn't get worse wait until you hear how 1 Diver tried to drown himself Jeffrey had seen this works are two of the most notorious figures in recent American history Both men have incredibly excused horrendous crimes and both the city green temperature before saving trial for their interest well the evidence against them is over I will recruit about A suspects only because they were not having no time AI models are amazing what they know and how they can Today I'm going to show you exactly what's happened with Jackson's Open i've just confirmed this company so it's a big mistake from the end and there's a crazy choice of noise changes in everything I'm going to be continuously employees and customers so I'm about to build a CPU mine gravy in 2025 and CPU mining unlike GPU mining has remained profitable for basically all this is a sanctuary city sacramento is not a sanctuary city the state of California is not a sanctuary state there is no sanctuary anywhere Sacramento But to see if that would look in here at the southern border at the lowest level to reported history that is freed up Border Patrol resources to come and help with interior immigration enforcement rejoin a Border Patrol California strike team as it came right here to Sacramento Carry out an operation will get right to that video take a look at this As soon as we pull up to a local Home Depot out here suspected illegal immigrants started taking off running in all directions pretty much as soon as I saw those federal agents pull up data immediately chasing these men down border Patrol tells us they ended up arresting eleven illegal aliens at this blind Home Depot parking several different critical histories Wanna show you this take a look at this US Citizen the guy in the right hand after 0 no I'm just watching TV actually watching the news Hey take me off speakerphone Child what kind of dog did you go after Oh yeah personality Dog got personality Is Matthew home for the summer I want your glasses for that was able to see I was able to see the class better What are you up to No not much it's right yeah yeah OK I had a black girls again Hello Yeah I know the feeling Why well once I put glasses on in the morning like a dude like computer work or something then you need them all day and then you try to take them off take them off and then you can't see **** Yeah yeah now I have that I got my truck out of shop I met this So this guy was we had working on one of our houses we knew a mechanic so I gave him a call and he's got a little bit choppy when I first talked to him on the phone but he sound like a cool dude so I went over and it's actually like his dad is a retired kind of like tow record dude and welder and then his son got doing all the work KK he's pretty cool too and so II gave this guy called KK and went over and he looked at my all my parts and stuff and he gave me a number and I said alright I can do that So we ended up I ended up going back and I was there all day I got there like 9:30 in the morning I didn't leave until like 6:00 in the evening but Oh my God he he basically rebuilt my whole front end put new put new shots all the way around Cost me 500 bucks Yeah yeah yeah yeah Yep so truck feels pretty good I gotta do a couple of things it it rides really well now I have a snapshot actually remember when it used to go over bumps they used to make a shimmer you know like one of my shots was snapped Yeah I have only shocks to install anyway but when he went to uninstall one he goes oh look at this one of the shock arms was just like busted completely off yeah he changed my upper control arms and CV axle and all joints and tire rod you did a good job yeah So when you come in this way I'm not sure i'm waiting to hear from my doctor I have all my medical records i'm trying to get her to give me temporary disability so you start making some cash Yeah as soon as I can get a temporary disability going she may have me come back see her at the office or something but I don't mind doing that because it'll come with someone on a week paycheck Yeah man I'm already like filed Morgan morgan for for for for my disability claim On but on the phone so something called that was temporary disability or full disability probably can't answer so don't say confidence when I said that I'm not going to call that place uh I'm that's all right we're gonna have a look at it you know what year or how much pay how much work for it but it is all right there on the phone Yeah might be too morgan and Morgan did all that with me and then they just sent it over to the state It's all done I did it like a week and a half ago Yeah Oh my God everything so Morgan and Morgan when they got off the phone with me they already were filing it when they Yeah that's what I mean that's why it was like I don't mind paying because I know I'm gonna get the maximum amount and just getting the maximum I can afford to pay them their fee you know just gotta how much did you were you going for I think mine should be somewhere between like 1800 and 2500 Yeah that's absolutely hard if you're supposed to go by 1915 no they don't they actually do not because it'll actually make you have too much money you they go on your own Because that was a part of what I was doing 'cause they were like what's your wife's social like no and then I'm like yeah I'm married and we do have a daughter at home but you don't want them including her income or you don't want them including Mike's income you would think but I think what it does is it over qualifies you or something something kind of crazy Yeah because I was asking my AI and it was like no you don't wanna combine your incomes or have them like do math on both your incomes you wanted to just be on your Yeah I did too I thought it would be better to clean your you get more money but no I think it hurts you actually And I'll have to put into some electronic electronic how do I sign up for it and also you have to get confidence to get the way you have to take it out You need to just put 200 away actually actually 300 a paycheck if you're getting $1000 your your tax rate should be about 22 to 25% so you need to put 25% away so that's 200-5200 $50$250 for every 1000 So if you get 1000 bucks your taxes are going to be 250 bucks right and you shouldn't think you have to pay on Social Security benefits What's the weather like hey Cortana actually last couple days been really mild we've had no humidity so our temps have been like 80 no humidity but today it's like today it's like 70 Yeah it's a little overcast got rain yesterday Yeah tell you why I take this weather anyway I want to explore more fun we'll start talking to you That's why I'm talking about call Yeah I can stay at one hour so I was going to go over I need to know about the stuff like that I have no friends is an appointment if there are Apple format Yeah no not really I do a lot of other stuff I was gonna go in one last night it's pretty cool it's like made out of shipping containers it's like this huge place I ran across it last night by by mistake and I was like oh **** there's a couple places I've seen that I really want to go to but you know I don't have no way to go to go with it I met a few cool dudes and you know we talked but you know I'm not really hanging out too much usually pretty busy Talk to Craig like about a month ago Tom and I hooked up on Facebook again so he's good same as Craig same as Craig he's still going to those head head banger concerts and getting drunk Drunk I don't know how that guy does it to be honest with you I said I don't know how he does it Yeah he's always like like every weekend he gets smashed like Friday and Saturday and then recovers like all Sunday it's like consistent once I cancel the I'm sure not you know like a couple of them I don't know when I just got one that I stopped like yeah I got somewhere and I stopped a lot for that Now you have a couple of can't find any of that even though you can't drink it Yep but value is very shed without Yeah I'm on the truck Yeah I was reading through my medical stuff the other day so my disk dropped foot I think is a side effect from my lower back Remember when I was taken out that furniture and throwing stuff away and I hurt myself like my back and my and then I was like I don't know why my foot's not working Yeah It's time to go home and it said I found my original disk for Dr Ronnie's office in my cabinet I was cleaning up my file cabinet and I found my old MRI my original one Yeah I was gonna actually bring it up and open it up see see what was on it because I'm sure it was all inflamed and ruptured Yeah definitely When they did this layup last one it showed it shows like fragments of the scar surgery around my nerve and I think that that's what's causing nerve block Yeah my neck is the same too I got that pinched nerve right in my cervical and it's making my hand numb they can put me on all the meds they want but it doesn't change the fact my next pinch Yeah they don't they're so cheap they don't wanna give me mris confirm I got a pinched nerve in my neck meanwhile do some shovel bunch of medicine down my throat and that And I'm like yo my hands still melt you know it's not acting it's not like electric but it's still numb and still like I can't have any feeling in my sense fingers I'm so sorry It's like he's not to say that but it doesn't feel wrong he was a story of like what are you talking about now you think you but you think the Wagner's is some sort of like long haul like side effect or something from Covid I don't know I'm just saying Alright bye Hey Yeah well that breathing thing was definitely synonymous with Covid remember Kind of remember like after it was all going down and stuff and then you're like I don't think I'm getting better Like then use like my breathings have been awesome No Sir Look how long it took them to diagnose it though You have to keep going on and on and on and on since someone got you finding the right diagnosis So that's what I was saying it's to me it seemed like you're going to be more like Long Long called Covad than Wagners because it all kind of fired up right after you know we all got shots and Covid came through it seemed like he just never really got back to where you were and then it just got progressively worse in some some areas Yeah start stacking and they start causing their own problems No you guys been getting a lot of flood arresting people call Rusty but what's going watch Guns on the Mountain Up there Yeah remember when remember when we were like coming over talking about and we went down by the fire department to the water up up there is considered I think that's all watched on Yeah I heard you guys get hit pretty good I can't hear you what you're saying Well you're saying he goes to work and leaves his dog what Yep Also Matthew and his brother could have did something where they could have took the dog and had a good day too so you know if he's not worried about it I don't think he should be worried about it Plumbing supply shop across the street come down came down big time the whole tree first move we've had some rock and storms come through here is what Yeah yeah same as you ever was in Tahiti doing everything Dorian still will I don't I had reminded him that he car insurance was due and their phone was due again And he says yeah I know yeah boy but I haven't had a chance to get to the bank yeah yeah boy Yep Yep And I go I go wow really I go well yeah boy is going to tell you you need to get your own phone insurance moving forward from here I'm tired of running after him and trying to get try to get him to cover the bills already paid for they they just they they're they're leaning on me like I'm the money man you know I was like yo come on and then like make sure you're paying it and they haven't they paid 50 bucks in the last three months it's it's like $400 and they paid 50 bucks That's what I'm saying yeah and then when I asked him about he acts like an **** so I told him they gotta get their own **** now probably Stop ordering all that fast food and **** You know them if I the one is if I go on my computer and go into his login I can see his email and his email last time I went in there like 80% of it was like grub hub and all that **** Alright cute I'm letting you go Yeah thanks for I'll be safe A very transparent of President Trump but even I am frankly amazed at what he has been able to do against all odds in such a very short period of time we're living through meditate come really close notes as you most likely never see this again in your lifetime The single most consequential transformational presidency in a lifetime and without a doubt the underlying name of the White House promises made right promises kept It's not a secret that I have been a long time pregnant supporter a very transparent President Trump including even I am frankly amazed at what he has been able to do against all odds in such a very short period of time what we're living through better take you know really close notes most likely never seen It's not a secret that I have been a long time friend and supporter of a very transparent of President Trump but even I am not lost by health care at least I own the lives I might have lost my food stamps at least millionaires got tax cuts I might have to work 80 hours a month to keep Medicaid but at least Walmart will allow me to use my Walker I think that's what I draw my voters with Trump i'm not a communist Of course I voted for Trump he's a successful businessman for the only successful business he has ever had is selling red hats to ignore people for her I might have lost my health care probably yeah I don't know they usually go pretty viral And he clearly did everything he could to deflect I explored the Olmec mystery in considerable depth can you explain that to people in the fingerprints of the guards yes so it's I explored the Olmec mystery in considerable depth to these finance people yes so it's considered to be the earliest high culture of Central America everybody's heard about the Aztecs everybody's heard about the fire but before the Aztecs and before the Maya there were a culture who are referred to as the Bolbanks sitting in the middle of it is this human figure who's holding this strange bag And just the fact that those identical bags are found in ancient Subway in the hands of individuals who were considered to be civilization bringers and they also show up on Pillar 43 and go back in Tekken what have I told you for right now a machine is reading messages that have remained silent for over three sounds a sophisticated hybrid AI system is reported to identify the SO America's oldest and most enigmatic civilization and set to glyphs carved into stone and buried for millennia and frustrated archeologists for generations but now something has changed For the first time we're getting glimpses of what these symbols might actually mean not decoded by human intuition but by algorithmic pattern range and what's emerging this is just academically interesting it's potentially alarming at least one decoded sequence has already triggered into debates Researchers have seen the criminal minds That's exactly why some of the world's leading archeologists and AI emphasis are increasingly concerned about what happens next The leap that nobody was talking about what I'm about to share hasn't reached mainstream media but according to multiple sources within archeological circles something extraordinary is happening those tools a specialized research team based in a prominent diversity Veracruz Mexico has been quietly working with a cutting edge hybrid AI system that's revealing patterns previously invisible This isn't your standard neural network the two developed a specialized system that combines symbolic pattern recognition algorithms with large language models specifically trained on thousands of Mesoamerican motifs and archeological cartoons On my previous attempts at decoded the Olmec symbols this approach doesn't try to translate directly instead it identifies statistical correlations between simple clusters celestial events agricultural science later lesser American cosmological systems the For the first time we're seeing compelling evidence that these aren't random decorative elements One translated sequence repeatedly references what the AI identifies as a sunny serpent that opens the Earth every 50 a description looked perfectly aligned with the Venus synodic cycle that would later become fundamental to Maya astronomical this is a coincidence it's a direct correlation that suggests the old method sophisticated celestial tracking systems centuries earlier than previously thought even more remarkable another cluster of symbols appears to encode a calendar reminder tracking both solstices and lunar eclipses with surprise and precision if verified this would push back the timeline of complex American astronomical record but hundreds of years forcing a complete reassessment Burton scientific knowledge many Americans so here's what that really means The old men weren't just carving and strangers some of these symbols might encode cosmology patterns of the star times maybe even myths passed down for thousands of years and it was the first two of the dentures The implications extend beyond the one specific symbol a distinctive toiled spiral appears repeatedly throughout his texts consistently alongside what researchers are cautiously describing as this systematic recording seems to trap resources ritual requirements or possibly natural phenomena tied to specific celestial alignment Some team members speculated might represent agricultural plan changes while others suggested could encode information about foreign sources mineral deposits or sacred sites across the ornaments territory what makes this particularly significant is that similar spiral motives appear at multiple sites separated by considerable distance suggesting a standardized symbolic language far more sophisticated than previous the trip to this ancient civilization Fitzpatrick told them under further analysis we may be witnessing the first pages of Mesoamerican scientific history being reopened after 3 pavilion circ they told us to This is where the story takes a concerning turn multiple sources have confirmed that at least 1 senior researcher from a prominent Mexico City laboratory has formally requested publication called Renewed Time to validate these interpretations rigorous researcher memo that wasn't meant to become
